# Renovate Program #

I started to renovate my friend's game because it looked fun when he was playing it. Unfortunately, he no longer works on the project so I renovated the game to the way I wanted it to be.

### How to install ###
 1) Install `python` in your computer.
 2) `Clone` / `Download` game from this `repository`
 3) Open game via `terminal`.
 4) Type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
 5) Open your favorite browser
 6) Type `http://localhost:8000/` as your website name
 7) Play it!
